    <p> So as you probably understand my name is Lola, I'm 19 years old and <strong>I am a second year student at <em>Ieseg School of Management</em> </strong>. 
        I come from <em>Amiens</em> in the north of France and I mooved to <em>Paris</em> in 2016. I have a cat named <em>O'Malley</em> and I really love it.
        Indeed it is so cute and it loves to play all the time with me. Before having a cat I do not really like animals. But The day I had it,
        I completly change my mind.</p>
